=====================================
- This took me 2.5 hours
- I struggled with linking to the register page because the tag helper would default to my home controller. I fixed this by specifying the controller AND action in my anchor tag.
- I learned how to add a model to my web app, scaffolding, and migration.
- I utilized the code demo, previous labs, TAs,and my classmates.
